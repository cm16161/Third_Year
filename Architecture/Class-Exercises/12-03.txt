1.a)  2 or 3 can be recognised first if the CPU is pipelined
b)    Those are the values of previous instructions currently being executed, they shouldn't be affected by an execption of the following instruction.
c)    0x44

2)    Instruction   Can be Moved?   Wasted Work on Branch   Wasted Work on Fall-Through
      addi          No              N/A                     N/A
      and           Yes             No                      No 
      slt           No              N/A                     N/A
      or            Yes             Yes                     No
      add           No              N/A                     N/A
      slt           Yes             No                      No  
      and           No              N/A                     N/A

3)    Machine 1: 25% * 20% * 1 flushed instruciton = 5% wasted
      Machine 2: 25% * 20% *2 flushed instructions = 10% wasted
