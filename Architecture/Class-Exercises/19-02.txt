1a) Don't cares means that we can use the same logic for different instructions and don't need to use all the bits for an operation.
 b) Single cycle speeds are restricted by the critical path of execution and generally have slower speeds than when pipelining is implemented
 c) MemtoReg and RegDst are inverses of each other, Branch and ALUOp0 can be used as a single signal.

2a) All 0's
 b) 00012080
 c) 10

3a) PC, Instruction Memory, Registers, ALU, Data Memory, Control, Mux's
 b) No new blocks needed
 c) No new signals needed
