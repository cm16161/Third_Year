1)

Numbers:

0.375 = 0 001 10000000 | 1.75 =  0 011 11000000

Input to Adders:

01100000 11000000

Result of Adders:

00100000, carry out 1, shift 1 right

increase exponent by 1

0 100 00010000



2)

i  ) The significand for 19.25 is 001101, and 0.140625 is 001000 so we need 6 bits
ii ) Exponent for 19.25 is 4, and exponent for 0.140625 is -3 so we need -3 to 4 which is 8 values and so we need 3 bits.
iii) Bias is 3
