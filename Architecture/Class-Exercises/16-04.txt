1a) An application that doesn't have many pipeline hazards can be restructured so that it would benefit from multiple processors despite not being a concurrent application.

 b) As the number of processesors increases, there is more demand for the shared L3 cache which would likely result in more cache misses.
 
 c) GPU's use multi-threading whereas vectors don't use multi-threading
 d) GPU's have a larger focus on Bandwidth rather than CPU's which focus on Latency, GPU's have smaller caches and NVIDIA doesn't build CPU's. 
 
2a) 1.5 = 1/(1-f)+f/2; f = 0.67
 b) 1/-2/3-1/6+(2/3/6)+(1/6/3); S = 3
 c) 98-6=92 additional processors
