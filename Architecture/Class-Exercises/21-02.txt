1a) For a single instruction pipelining doesn't improve latency but with a large number of instructions it does. This is because processes can start the execution cycle earlier when pipelining is implemented.
 b) Dependencies for data values means that even with pipelining, sometimes there still needs to be stalls.

2)  Register     Instruction Line#     Type of Dependency         Data Hazard?
    $s3          L1                    WAR                        No
    $s3          L2                    RAW                        Yes
    $s2          L3                    RAW                        Yes
    $s3          L3                    WAR                        No
    $s2, $s3     L4                    RAW                        Yes

3)  24 Cycles, Instructions: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 stall
4a) 5 times speedup
 b) 20/9 = 2.2x speedup
 c) Assuming there are no stalls then yes it is faster since each instruction would finish after 4.4ns compared to the 5 stage pipline which would take 5ns.
